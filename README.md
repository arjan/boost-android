This project is an attempt to write a Kotlin Android app that can interface with the LEGO Boost Move Hub via Bluetooth LE.

Eventually it will be expanded to allow control of the Move Hub and PF2 Hub simultaneously.

The Google sample project (https://github.com/googlesamples/android-BluetoothLeGatt/) was instrumental in providing an understanding of the Android Bluetooth SDK

The reverse engineering project by JorgePe (https://github.com/JorgePe/BOOSTreveng) was instrumental in providing an understanding of the Boost interface.
